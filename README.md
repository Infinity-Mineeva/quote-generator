Introduction
---

This is the first project from the excellent **JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio** from the awesome [Zero To Mastery website](https://zerotomastery.io/).


This project makes a fetch request to a Quote API and presents the user with a random quote from the JSON response received. The user can then generate another quote, or tweet out the quote

Methodology
---

I followed the tutorial from beginning to end; only making changes to the background and fonts chosen during the initial setup.

After the initial setup, which included choosing a background pattern from [Hero Patterns Background](https://www.heropatterns.com/) and fonts from Google Fonts, we moved on to the JavaScript where we made a call to the [Inspirational Quotes API](https://quotes-react.netlify.app/), and choose a random quote to display one of the available quotes.

The Buttons to Tweet out the Quote and to generate a new quote were then wired up. The documentation referenced for making the Tweet Quote button work can be found [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/tweet-button/guides/web-intent).

I don't think I've ever built a project with the ability to Tweet things out, so it was nice to see how simple it was to add that functionality.

Stylistically,

Items for further study
---

For this, I would like to add a way for users to Favourite the quotes they like. For this, I'll have to add some sort of register capabilities, I think.
